**`Python developer`**

Hi! I'm DuÅ¡Ğ°n MiletiÄ‡ and I am a novice python developer and a freelancer. Interesed in web development, creating beautiful websites and specialized web apps. Started learning Python on my own, learning from written materials and tutorials on the web. Wanted to get a deeper knowledge of programming and Python in general so I finished a one year course for Python developers and got certified. My goal is to become a full stack web developer.
